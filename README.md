LAB 1b - S3 Creation

Firstly, I logged into my AWS Management Console using my credentials. Once logged in, I navigated to the Amazon S3 service by clicking on it from the list of available services. Then, I clicked on the "Create bucket" button. In the bucket creation form, I entered a unique name for my bucket, chose the region where I want to create it, and left other settings as default. After confirming the creation, my bucket appeared in the dashboard.

After creating the S3 we can see the empty s3 bucket as shown in the below figure.

Next, I proceeded to upload a file to the newly created bucket. I clicked on the bucket name to enter it, then hit the "Upload" button. In the upload dialog, I selected the file from my local machine and clicked "Upload" again. The file was successfully uploaded to the S3 bucket

Add file or folder in your s3 bucket in current path or in a folder. And click on upload button

Now, it was time to download the uploaded file. I selected the uploaded file by clicking on its checkbox and then clicked the "Download" button. The file was downloaded to my local machine without any issues.

To empty the bucket, I selected all files within it using the checkboxes beside their names. Then, I clicked on the "Actions" dropdown menu and chose "Delete". A confirmation dialog popped up, and after confirming, all files were deleted from the bucket.

After clicking the file, we can see the window that is asking again to Delete the file permanently. Here Type “permanently delete” text to delete the file permanently. 
Lastly, I decided to delete the entire bucket. I selected the bucket by clicking on its checkbox, clicked on the "Delete" button, and confirmed the deletion in the dialog box that appeared. The bucket was removed from the S3 service successfully.

Now again my bucket is empty and waiting for upload file until we delete the Bucket.
So, be aware of charges and bills that produced by this Service and use this efficiently.
This document serves as a record of my actions in creating and managing an Amazon S3 bucket via the AWS Management Console.
